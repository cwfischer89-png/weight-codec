Yes — but only partially, and it depends on what you mean by "without sacrificing precision."

There are a few main approaches to compressing LLM weights:

1. Pruning and Sparsity

How it works: Removes redundant or low-magnitude weights.

Effect on precision: If done carefully (structured pruning, magnitude pruning, or learned sparsity), the model’s precision in outputs can be maintained. However, pruning too aggressively usually hurts accuracy unless followed by fine-tuning.

Trade-off: Smaller memory footprint and faster inference, but potential slight loss in generalization if not retrained.

2. Quantization

How it works: Stores weights in lower precision (e.g., 8-bit, 4-bit, sometimes even 2-bit) instead of 16- or 32-bit floating point.

Effect on precision: This reduces numerical precision of individual weights, but with techniques like quantization-aware training or mixed-precision schemes, the effect on model accuracy can be minimal.

Trade-off: Saves a lot of memory and bandwidth. True “no sacrifice” in mathematical precision is impossible here, but you can keep accuracy nearly unchanged.

3. Low-Rank Factorization / Matrix Decomposition

How it works: Approximates large weight matrices with lower-rank factors.

Effect on precision: Can maintain close to original accuracy if chosen ranks are large enough.

Trade-off: Reduces parameter count, but introduces approximation error.

4. Weight Sharing and Clustering

How it works: Groups similar weights and stores only representative values.

Effect on precision: This inevitably introduces approximation, but fine-tuning can recover a lot of the lost accuracy.

Trade-off: Strong compression, but more lossy.

Bottom Line

If by precision you mean “numeric bit-exactness of weights,” then no, compression always sacrifices some.

If by precision you mean “task performance/accuracy,” then yes — with methods like 8-bit quantization, pruning + retraining, or low-rank factorization, you can dramatically shrink an LLM while keeping its real-world precision (outputs, benchmark scores) almost the same.

?? For most production-grade LLM deployments today (e.g., GPTQ, AWQ, bitsandbytes), 8-bit or 4-bit quantization strikes the best balance: compression with little to no practical loss in accuracy.

Would you like me to break down which of these techniques is best depending on your target — memory footprint, inference speed, or minimizing accuracy loss?

You said:
there are a lot of advnaced compression algorithims related to video, images and audio, could any techniques those use be relevant in compressing the size of stored weights with minimal loss
ChatGPT said:

That’s a great line of thinking. You’re right: video, image, and audio codecs (JPEG, HEVC, MP3, Opus, etc.) have decades of work behind them in perceptual compression — exploiting redundancy, human perceptual limits, and clever transforms. Some of those ideas can be (and in some cases already are) adapted to LLM weight compression, but others don’t translate well because neural network weights aren’t signals we “consume” directly. Here’s how they map:

1. Transform Coding (DCT, Wavelets)

In media: JPEG uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT); JPEG2000 uses wavelets. These decorrelate pixel values, making many coefficients small enough to quantize heavily.

For weights: You could transform weight tensors into another domain (e.g., block-wise DCT) and then quantize/compress them. This has been studied: weight “frequency components” are often highly redundant.

Relevance: Promising for storage/compression, though you still need to decompress to use them at inference (unless you design custom hardware).

2. Entropy Coding (Huffman, Arithmetic, ANS)

In media: After quantization, codecs use entropy coding to squeeze out statistical redundancy.

For weights: Directly applicable — weight distributions are not uniform. Many quantization-aware compression schemes for neural nets already use entropy coding.

Relevance: Highly relevant and widely used — can reduce storage by ~20–40% on top of quantization.

3. Perceptual Models

In media: Human vision and hearing tolerate some loss; compression targets things we don’t notice.

For weights: There’s no “perceptual system” for weights. But there is a “tolerance” in how much a model’s accuracy drops when you distort certain weights more than others. Some methods approximate this by measuring Hessian sensitivity or gradient importance of weights.

Relevance: Conceptually similar — “don’t waste bits on things the model doesn’t care about.” Already used in structured pruning and importance-based quantization.

4. Temporal/Spatial Redundancy Exploitation

In media: Video codecs exploit similarity between frames; audio exploits correlation between samples.

For weights: Weights in nearby positions in tensors are often correlated too. Delta coding (storing differences instead of raw values) and block-wise schemes are directly applicable.

Relevance: Useful for storage; less so for runtime since GPUs prefer raw aligned arrays.

5. Dictionary Learning / Vector Quantization

In media: Codebooks are used (e.g., CELP in speech codecs).

For weights: Cluster similar weight values and replace them with shared representatives + indices. This is exactly weight sharing / k-means quantization, a well-known neural net compression trick.

Relevance: Already applied successfully in neural network compression.

6. Progressive / Scalable Coding

In media: JPEG2000 or scalable video codecs allow coarse-to-fine decoding.

For weights: You could imagine storing a coarse quantized model plus residuals, letting you trade off model quality vs size on the fly.

Relevance: Could be very useful for distributing large models and scaling precision depending on device.

? Summary:

Directly useful: Entropy coding, vector quantization, delta coding, and transform-based compression.

Conceptually similar: Perceptual weighting ? importance-based pruning/quantization.

Already applied: Codebook compression (like audio), entropy coding, Hessian-based importance.

Less relevant: Things relying specifically on human sensory limits.

In practice, the most successful techniques combine quantization + entropy coding + pruning — which is analogous to “transform ? quantize ? entropy encode” in JPEG/MP3.

Would you like me to sketch out a pipeline for LLM weight compression that explicitly borrows from video/image codec design (like a “JPEG for weights”)? That could make the parallels very clear.

You said:
any specific from vp9 or av1 that is applicable
ChatGPT said:

Yes — both VP9 and AV1 (modern video codecs) bring in ideas that do have analogues for weight compression in LLMs. Here are the main ones:

1. Block Partitioning & Adaptive Coding

In AV1/VP9: Frames are divided into variable-sized blocks (superblocks ? sub-blocks). Each block is coded differently depending on its content (flat vs detailed).

For weights: Instead of compressing the whole tensor uniformly, you partition weight matrices into blocks. Flat blocks (where weights are nearly constant) can be heavily compressed or quantized more aggressively, while high-variance blocks get more precision.

Practical benefit: Adaptive compression — less “one-size-fits-all” quantization, more efficient storage without large accuracy drops.

Existing work: Similar to blockwise quantization and adaptive precision methods.

2. Predictive Coding (Intra/Inter Prediction)

In AV1/VP9: A block’s values are predicted from neighbors (spatial prediction) or from past/future frames (temporal prediction). Only the residual (difference) is coded.

For weights: Weight tensors have strong correlations across rows/columns. You can predict weights based on neighbors (row-wise or filter-wise), and only store residuals.

Practical benefit: Residuals tend to be small and compress well with entropy coding.

Existing work: Some neural net compression methods already do delta coding of weights — this is essentially the same as intra prediction.

3. Transform Coding

In AV1/VP9: Residuals are transformed with DCT, ADST, or other transforms to decorrelate values, then quantized.

For weights: Apply DCT (or even learned transforms) to weight blocks before quantization. This concentrates “energy” in fewer coefficients, which can be quantized more aggressively.

Practical benefit: Similar to JPEG — good for storage and bandwidth.

Existing work: Some research applies FFT/DCT to weights, but not widely adopted in production yet.

4. Entropy Coding (ANS, Context-Adaptive Coding)

In AV1: Uses Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) and context-adaptive probability models.

For weights: After quantization, weight values are highly non-uniform. Entropy coding can shrink storage by 20–40% without any accuracy impact.

Practical benefit: Already used in many model compression schemes (Huffman, range coding, ANS).

Existing work: Integrated into TensorFlow Lite’s model compression pipeline.

5. Perceptual / Rate-Distortion Optimization

In AV1/VP9: Quantization is guided by rate–distortion optimization: choose quantization that balances bitrate vs perceptual loss.

For weights: Replace “perceptual loss” with accuracy sensitivity (e.g., Hessian-based weight importance). Important weights get more bits, unimportant ones get fewer.

Practical benefit: Avoids uniform quantization; can push compression harder where it doesn’t affect accuracy.

? Takeaway:
The most transferable ideas from VP9/AV1 to LLMs are:

Blockwise adaptive quantization (superblocks ? weight blocks)

Predictive coding of weight residuals (neighbor prediction)

Transform coding (DCT/ADST) of blocks before quantization

Entropy coding (ANS) for final storage

Rate-distortion optimization guided by accuracy sensitivity

That’s essentially a “video-codec-inspired” pipeline for neural net weights:
Predict ? Transform ? Quantize ? Entropy Encode, tuned by accuracy impact.

Would you like me to design a step-by-step pipeline for a “VP9/AV1-style codec for LLM weights,” showing what each stage would look like in practice (with an example on, say, a Transformer layer)?

You said:
Which concepts are the most promising and also not well exploited yet in LLMs
ChatGPT said:

Great question — because a lot of the “easy wins” (8-bit / 4-bit quantization, pruning, entropy coding) are already well-studied, so the frontier is in the less-tapped codec-style ideas.

Here’s a breakdown of which AV1/VP9 concepts look most promising but are under-explored in LLM compression:

?? 1. Predictive Coding for Weights (Intra/Inter Prediction)

Status in LLMs: Lightly explored. Most current schemes just delta-encode sequential weights.

Why promising: Weight matrices in transformers have strong correlations — e.g., attention projection weights often vary smoothly across rows/columns. If you predict a weight from its neighbors (like AV1 intra prediction), the residuals are much smaller and more compressible.

Gap: Very few libraries exploit structured prediction; most just quantize values independently.

?? 2. Transform Coding of Weight Blocks

Status in LLMs: Rare. Some academic work has applied DCT or wavelets, but it hasn’t made it into mainstream toolchains.

Why promising: Like images, many weight tensors have low-frequency structure. DCT or learned transforms could concentrate “signal” in fewer coefficients, letting you discard/quantize high-frequency parts without hurting accuracy.

Gap: Not widely adopted — probably because GPUs prefer raw float arrays. Needs research into “on-the-fly” transforms that don’t bottleneck inference.

?? 3. Rate–Distortion Optimization Guided by Model Sensitivity

Status in LLMs: Mostly absent. Current quantizers often use uniform or layer-wise heuristics.

Why promising: AV1 dynamically allocates bits where they matter for visual quality. Analogously, you can allocate precision based on Hessian sensitivity or gradient importance. That means some weights could be aggressively quantized while others stay high precision — for the same storage, you’d get better accuracy.

Gap: Only a few papers touch this; no standardized pipeline exists yet.

?? 4. Progressive / Scalable Coding for Weights

Status in LLMs: Almost untouched. Models are usually distributed in a fixed precision.

Why promising: Imagine distributing a 2-bit base model, then progressively sending “residual” bitplanes (like AV1 scalable layers). Edge devices could stop early, servers could decode fully. This also allows streaming models over networks.

Gap: This is very under-researched and could be huge for deployment efficiency.

?? 5. Context-Adaptive Entropy Coding (ANS-style with learned contexts)

Status in LLMs: Huffman/Range coding is used, but usually without context adaptation.

Why promising: Weight distributions differ by layer and even by block. AV1 exploits context modeling for much better compression. Applying context-adaptive probability models could reduce storage further without changing the math of inference.

Gap: Not widely used — most frameworks stick to simpler coding for ease of decoding.

? Most promising, under-exploited directions:

Predictive coding of weight blocks (neighbor prediction ? small residuals).

Transform coding (DCT/learned transforms ? compressible coefficients).

Rate–distortion optimization using accuracy sensitivity (smart bit allocation).

Progressive/scalable weight coding (streaming / adaptive deployment).

Context-adaptive entropy coding (ANS with local statistics).

If I had to bet: (1) predictive coding + (3) accuracy-aware rate-distortion are the low-hanging fruit that could give real storage wins with minimal accuracy loss. (4) progressive coding is the most disruptive — it could change how models are delivered (like scalable video).

Do you want me to sketch what a prototype pipeline would look like if we built a “mini-AV1 for LLM weights,” combining the best of these under-exploited ideas?

You said:
For option 2 could any of a gpu's pre existing decoding hardware be used to accelerate decompression or clever algorithims be used to make decompression a trivial computational cost
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 22s

Short answer: you usually can’t reuse the video decode blocks (NVDEC/VCN/QuickSync) to decompress weight tensors—they’re fixed-function for specific bitstreams and surfaces. But you can make decompression essentially “free” by designing the codec around what GPUs are great at: massively parallel integer math, texture fetch, and fused kernels. Here’s what actually works.

What (mostly) won’t help

Hardware video decoders (VP9/AV1 blocks): locked to those codecs, frame formats, and driver paths. You can’t point them at arbitrary DCT/ANS payloads for matmuls.

Feeding weights as fake video: in practice you hit API constraints, staging overhead, copy/format conversions, and it breaks kernel fusion. Net gain is unlikely.

What will help (and can make decode cost trivial)
1) Treat weights as “GPU-native compressed data”

Texture compression (BCn / ASTC) for storage + sampling: Pack weight tiles into 2D textures using block compression. The texture units decompress on fetch. In a custom matmul kernel, read via tex2D (nearest, no filtering) and convert to FP16.

Pros: decompression is effectively “free” (part of the texture path), great cache behavior.

Cons: formats are lossy and 2D-oriented; you need a tiling that preserves matmul locality and control quantization error.

GPU bulk decompression for file I/O: Use DirectStorage GPU decompression / GDeflate or nvCOMP (LZ4, Zstd, GDeflate) to move from disk ? GPU RAM fast. This removes CPU from the path and hides I/O time under upload/compute. You still quantize/dequantize weights for compute, but the heavy I/O compression is offloaded.

2) Blockwise integer transforms that map to fast kernels

Design the “codec” so decode = a few adds/mults per weight block:

Small integer transforms (e.g., 4×4/8×8 DCT-II approximations) on blocks. Store int8 coefficients + per-block scales/zero-points.

Dequant + inverse transform fused into the matmul kernel prologue:

Load compressed block ? shared memory

IDCT-like butterfly (adds/shifts)

Multiply by per-coef scale(s) ? FP16 (or keep INT8 and use tensor cores)

Write to registers used immediately by the MMA

Because the inverse transform is ~O(n) adds/shifts per tile and happens once per tile reuse, the overhead is usually hidden by math/bandwidth of the GEMM.

3) Codebook / vector-quantized blocks with rANS/Huffman outside the hot loop

At load time per layer (not per token):

Entropy-decode (rANS/Huffman) many blocks in parallel on GPU (nvCOMP or custom).

Replace each block by indices into a small codebook (vector quantization).

In the GEMM kernel, a register-resident codebook turns “decode” into just ld.indirect + scale—cheap.

Key trick: don’t entropy-decode inside the tight matmul. Do it once per layer load so runtime cost is amortized.

4) Bitplane packing with warp-level ops

Store coefficients as bitplanes; decode by warp ballots/shuffles:

Load 32/64 bits, use __ballot_sync/__shfl_sync (CUDA) to expand to bytes, apply per-block scales.

Extremely fast, branch-free, coalesced memory.

Works great for 2–4 bit quantizers and can be fused into the MMA prologue.

5) Lean on tensor cores for dequantization

Keep weights INT8/INT4 in memory; store per-tile/row scales in FP16.

Use tensor cores (IMMA/DP4A/FP8) to do dequant-on-the-fly: multiply activations by scales or fold scales into activation path; this turns “decode” into math the tensor core already does.

A practical blueprint (fast + simple)

File I/O: GDeflate/DirectStorage ? GPU RAM (nvCOMP if you’re on CUDA).

Layer init (once): Parallel rANS/Huffman decode ? tiled INT4/INT8 + per-tile scales/codebooks in global memory.

Compute (per token): Custom GEMM kernel that:

Loads a tile ? shared memory

(Option A) Bitplane expand or IDCT-lite butterfly (~a few dozen ops per 8×8)

Apply scale/zero-point ? INT8/FP16

Immediately feed tensor cores for MMA

Reuse decompressed tile for K iterations before evict

(Optional) Use texture fetch path if you commit to BC/ASTC storage and write GEMM to read via texture units.

Expected overhead

If you keep entropy decode out of the hot loop and use block sizes like 8×8/16×16, the added ALU per tile is tiny compared to the MMA. In practice, the incremental runtime can be <1–3% for IDCT-lite/bitplane expansion, often fully hidden by memory latency. The bigger wins are VRAM saved and I/O speedups.

Bottom line

Video decode hardware: not the right tool.

Texture units, tensor cores, SMs + nvCOMP/DirectStorage: exactly the right tools.

With the right block design and kernel fusion, decompression becomes near-free relative to the matmul you were doing anyway.

If you want, I can sketch a kernel layout (shared-memory tiling, registers, and a toy 8×8 integer inverse transform) you can drop into a CUTLASS-style GEMM.

for 3. Rate–Distortion Optimization Guided by Model Sensitivity, how would you know which weights are more important than others
ChatGPT said:

Excellent follow-up — this is the hard part. In video codecs, “distortion” is what the human eye sees; in LLMs, it’s what hurts model accuracy or loss. You need a proxy for “importance” of each weight (or group of weights). There are several ways to estimate it, ranging from lightweight heuristics to heavy-duty math:

?? 1. Magnitude Heuristic (Simple but Crude)

Idea: Larger weights matter more; small weights can be pruned or quantized aggressively.

Why used: Very cheap (just scan weights).

Limitations: Not always true — some small weights are critical in sensitive layers, and some large ones are redundant.

Use case: Often combined with other methods as a first filter.

?? 2. Gradient Sensitivity (Loss Derivative)

Idea: Importance ? how much the loss would change if you perturbed or removed a weight.

Method: Use the gradient of the loss wrt each weight from training or calibration data:

Interpretation: If

? is large, that weight is “important.”

Cost: Requires backpropagation on a calibration set, but much cheaper than retraining.

?? 3. Second-Order / Hessian Sensitivity (More Accurate)

Idea: Use curvature of the loss landscape to measure how sensitive performance is to changes in a weight.

Method:

Strengths: Theoretically grounded; widely cited in pruning research.

Weaknesses: Computing Hessians is expensive; often approximated with Fisher Information.

?? 4. Layer-wise or Block-wise Sensitivity

Idea: Instead of per-weight, group weights into blocks (e.g., 8×8 tiles, attention heads, or entire layers).

Method: Perturb one group at a time (quantize/prune) and measure validation loss increase.

Strengths: Matches how codecs operate (blockwise).

Weaknesses: More coarse, but much more practical than per-weight estimates.

?? 5. Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)

Idea: FIM approximates sensitivity by looking at expected curvature of the loss wrt parameters.

Use case: Widely used in Elastic Weight Consolidation and model compression.

Strengths: Captures importance statistically, not just deterministically.

Weaknesses: Still requires data and gradient passes.

?? 6. Empirical Perturbation (Direct Measurement)

Idea: Perturb weights/blocks, run inference on a validation set, measure accuracy drop.

Strengths: No approximations — directly measures importance.

Weaknesses: Expensive; only feasible at block/layer granularity.

?? 7. Structural / Semantic Importance

Idea: Some weights are inherently more important because of where they live:

Embedding + output projection layers: More sensitive.

Attention query/key matrices: Small errors ? big impact on alignment.

Intermediate feed-forward layers: Often more redundant.

Use case: Combine structural priors with sensitivity estimates for better results.

? Best Practical Approach Today

Start with layer/block granularity (not individual weights).

Estimate importance via Fisher Information or gradient sensitivity on a small calibration set.

Allocate more bits / less aggressive quantization to “high-importance” blocks; compress aggressively where sensitivity is low.

This mimics rate–distortion optimization in AV1: spend bitrate where the “viewer” (the model’s loss) notices most.

Do you want me to show you what a rate–distortion optimization loop would look like for LLM weights (basically the codec’s “bit allocation” step, but guided by loss instead of pixels)?

You said:
expand on 4. Progressive / Scalable Coding for Weights
ChatGPT said:

Great — this one’s exciting because it borrows almost directly from video codecs like AV1/VP9, but it hasn’t really been explored for LLMs. Let me break it down.

?? Progressive / Scalable Coding for LLM Weights
?? Analogy from Video

In AV1/VP9, you can transmit a video in layers:

Base layer: low resolution / low bitrate, watchable on its own.

Enhancement layers: refinements (higher res, higher quality) you can add if bandwidth and device allow.

If your connection is slow, you just stop at the base layer; if fast, you keep decoding more layers.

?? Applied to LLM Weights

Imagine shipping a model not as one fixed-precision file (e.g., 16-bit), but as progressive refinements:

Base Model (coarse weights)

All weights stored with very low precision, say 2–4 bits.

Enough to run the model, but accuracy may be slightly degraded.

Fits on smaller devices, loads quickly.

Enhancement Layers (residual refinements)

Encode the difference between the coarse weights and a higher-precision version.

Organized as additional “bitplanes” or blocks you can stream in later.

Example: Base = 2-bit quantization, add one residual layer = 4-bit effective precision, add another = 8-bit effective precision.

Scalable Inference

Devices or servers decide how much refinement to load.

Edge devices stop at the base layer; servers load all layers for full accuracy.

A hybrid is possible: run some layers in high precision (critical attention layers) and others only with the base.

?? Implementation Strategies
Bitplane Coding

Represent weights in binary bitplanes (like JPEG2000 does for pixels).

Transmit least significant planes only if needed.

Early planes = coarse approximation; later planes = refinements.

Cheap to implement: decoding just means shifting and OR’ing integers.

Residual Coding

Quantize weights to 4-bit ? decode and run model.

Add an 8-bit residual tensor (difference between real weight and 4-bit decode).

Accumulate residuals for higher quality.

Works like video “enhancement layers.”

Blockwise Progressive Coding

Partition weights into blocks (8×8, 16×16).

Some blocks get full precision first (important layers/heads).

Refinements added adaptively for less critical blocks only if bandwidth allows.

?? Benefits

Adaptive Deployment

Same model file serves phones, laptops, and datacenter GPUs.

No need to maintain multiple quantized versions (2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit).

Streaming Models

Like watching YouTube at 144p ? 1080p as bandwidth improves.

Model can start serving queries immediately at low precision, refining itself in the background.

Graceful Degradation

If storage/bandwidth limited, you still have a usable model.

Ideal for on-device AI or slow internet scenarios.

Dynamic Bit Allocation

You can load more refinements for critical layers only.

Example: embeddings and output projection at full 8-bit, middle MLP layers stuck at 4-bit.

?? Challenges

Training / Calibration:
You need to train or fine-tune models to be robust at different precisions, otherwise the “base” model might underperform.

Runtime Support:
GPUs/TPUs prefer contiguous tensors. Progressive coding means decode-on-load or custom kernels.

Compression Efficiency:
Residual layers must be entropy-coded well, otherwise you lose efficiency.

?? Research Potential

This is almost untouched in LLM literature. Some bitplane quantization and residual quantization work exists in older NN compression, but true scalable coding for weights (like AV1 scalable video) is barely explored. It could change distribution models:

Hugging Face could host a single scalable model instead of multiple quantized checkpoints.

Edge devices could download just the base, while data centers download all layers.

“Progressive refinement” could even happen while the model is running.

? Summary:
Progressive coding would let us ship one model that scales precision on demand. A 2-bit base with residual “layers” could serve both phones and supercomputers, with no need to retrain separate models. It’s a codec-inspired approach that’s almost entirely unexploited today — and potentially one of the biggest wins for efficient model distribution and deployment.

Do you want me to sketch a concrete progressive pipeline (bitplane ? residual ? entropy coding), like a “JPEG2000 for LLM weights,” with an example of how a 16-bit weight tensor could be streamed in stages?

You said:
would this help the models be smaller for the same given level of performance or just make distribution and scaling easier
ChatGPT said:

Great distinction ?? — progressive/scalable weight coding does two different things depending on how you use it:

?? 1. For a fixed accuracy target

If your end goal is “match full-precision performance,” progressive coding usually won’t make the final model smaller than the best single-pass quantization scheme.

Why: the base + enhancement layers must reconstruct the same values you’d store in (say) an 8-bit or mixed-precision model. Entropy coding can still help, but you don’t magically beat the information-theoretic limit.

In practice: A progressive 8-bit model will be about the same size as a flat 8-bit quantized model (maybe a little larger because of overhead).

?? 2. For deployment and scaling

Here is where progressive coding shines:

Adaptive distribution: You don’t ship multiple versions (2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit). You ship one stream and let devices stop early.

Fast start-up: Start serving at low precision immediately, then “upgrade” weights in the background.

Mixed precision allocation: Critical blocks can be “refined” fully, while redundant blocks stay coarse — essentially accuracy-aware bit allocation.

?? 3. Where it can shrink size at equal performance

If combined with importance-aware allocation (rate–distortion optimization), you don’t need to refine all weights.

Example:

Embeddings, attention projections ? refine up to 8-bit.

Middle FFN blocks ? stop at 4-bit.

Net effect: for the same accuracy, total storage can drop compared to a flat “everything-8-bit” scheme, because you spend bits only where they matter.

So:

Plain progressive coding = mainly about distribution/scalability.

Progressive + selective refinement (importance-guided) = can actually give you a smaller model at the same performance.

? Bottom line:

By itself, progressive coding ? smaller final model; it ? same size but more flexible.

If you use it smartly (stop refining where accuracy is insensitive), you can indeed end up with a smaller model for the same level of performance.

Would you like me to sketch how such an importance-guided progressive scheme could look in practice (like a workflow where you allocate bitplanes adaptively per layer/head)?

You said:
if you did the base  + enhancement layers would the model in compressed form at least be smaller than a quantisized equivalent  
ChatGPT said:

Good question — let’s tease this apart carefully.

?? Standard Quantization (e.g., uniform 8-bit)

Each weight gets the same number of bits.

If you choose 8-bit quantization, every weight = 1 byte (plus some per-tensor scales/offsets).

That’s already quite compact, but also somewhat “wasteful”: not every weight needs 8 bits.

?? Base + Enhancement Layers (Progressive Coding)

Here’s what happens if you split into bitplanes or residual layers:

Base Layer:

Store the most important bits (e.g., top 2–4 bits).

Captures the coarse value.

Typically compresses very well (predictable structure, low entropy).

Enhancement Layers:

Store refinements (lower significance bits or residuals).

These are often very low entropy — e.g., many zeros or small ranges — which means entropy coding (rANS, Huffman, ANS) can squash them a lot more than the base layer.

Result:

Same effective precision as flat 8-bit quantization if you keep all layers.

But the overall storage can be smaller than uniform 8-bit quantization, because entropy coding can exploit the statistics of each layer separately.

?? Example (toy numbers)

Say you want 8-bit equivalent precision:

Flat 8-bit quantization: 1.00× model size baseline.

Progressive 2-bit base + 6-bit enhancements:

Base layer might compress to ~1.5 bits/weight (because coarse values cluster).

Enhancement residuals might compress to ~3.5 bits/weight.

Total = 5.0 bits/weight effective.

That’s ~37% smaller than uniform 8-bit quantization.

?? In practice: People already see this in bitplane coding + entropy coding — the lower bitplanes are cheap to store because they’re sparse/uniform.

?? Trade-offs

Yes, compressed size can be smaller than flat quantization for the same effective precision.

The gain depends on how well the codec exploits redundancy:

If you just naively split bits and don’t entropy code ? no savings.

If you combine progressive residual coding + entropy coding ? real wins.

Overhead of metadata (indices, block headers) must be kept tiny; blockwise coding works better than per-weight.

? Bottom line:
A progressive base + enhancement scheme can indeed make the stored model smaller than a quantized equivalent, if you apply entropy coding or residual compression to each layer.

Inference-time model (after reconstruction): same size as quantized equivalent.

On-disk / in-transit compressed form: smaller.

Do you want me to sketch a numerical worked example (say, 1M weights, base = 2 bits, enhancements = 6 bits, with estimated entropy savings per layer) so you can see how much smaller the compressed form gets compared to plain 8-bit quantization?

You said:
is bitplane coding + entropy coding already widespread and is this pretty similar in result?
ChatGPT said:

You’ve nailed the core idea — bitplane coding + entropy coding is exactly the “base + enhancement layers” approach in another language. Let’s break down where it stands today in neural network compression vs. classical media codecs:

?? How it works (quick recap)

Bitplane coding: Split each weight (say, 8-bit quantized) into binary planes (MSB, …, LSB).

Early planes (MSBs) capture coarse structure ? high entropy but crucial.

Later planes (LSBs) look more like random noise ? often low entropy, sometimes almost constant.

Entropy coding (rANS, Huffman, arithmetic coding, ANS): Compress each plane separately, exploiting statistics.

So you essentially get a progressive refinement scheme: decode MSBs only for a coarse model, decode all planes for full precision.

?? Current Status in LLM Compression

Not widespread in production toolchains (PyTorch, HuggingFace, TensorRT, etc. don’t do this yet).

Explored in research:

Some papers on bitplane quantization for neural nets (often paired with Huffman coding).

More often used in model checkpoint compression (to reduce on-disk storage), less so in deployed inference pipelines.

What’s more common today:

Uniform INT8/INT4 quantization.

Vector quantization / codebooks.

Entropy coding of the quantized weights as a post-process (sometimes).

What’s missing: Widespread adoption of progressive bitplane storage + runtime decode. Most systems just load a flat quantized tensor.

?? How it compares to “progressive / scalable coding”

Very similar in spirit:

Base layer = MSBs.

Enhancement layers = additional bitplanes.

Entropy coding makes the “enhancement layers” much smaller on disk.

Difference:

Bitplane coding is a fixed scheme: you always peel bits in order.

Scalable/residual coding could be more flexible: you might refine only certain layers, blocks, or even directions in weight space (importance-guided).

So:

Bitplane + entropy = a simple form of progressive coding.

Scalable coding = a generalized version that can prioritize where refinement matters, not just which bitplanes.

?? Results in practice

On-disk size: Yes, bitplane + entropy coding can beat flat 8-bit quantization in storage (often ~30–50% smaller).

In-memory / inference: After decompression, it’s the same as plain quantization — no runtime savings unless you run directly on bitplanes (rare, though possible with custom kernels).

Flexibility: True scalable schemes could decide to stop refining certain layers (not just truncate LSBs globally), which might shrink final model size at equal accuracy.

? Summary:

Bitplane coding + entropy coding is already known in NN compression, but not widely deployed in LLM toolchains.

It gives results similar to the “base + enhancement layers” concept — but in a more rigid form.

The big opportunity is going beyond plain bitplanes: making refinement importance-aware (some weights/layers get more planes, others stop early). That’s where scalable coding can outdo standard quantization.

Do you want me to outline what’s already implemented in libraries (like TensorFlow Lite, ONNX, Nvidia’s nvCOMP) vs. what would require new research for LLMs? That way you’d know what’s “available now” versus “blue-sky research.”

is their any interesting algorithims we can adapt to push this farther, something related to our previous discussions on video codecs?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 18s

Absolutely—there are several codec-era tricks we can adapt to push progressive/scalable weight coding much farther. Here are the most promising, with concrete ways to apply them to LLM weights.

1) Intra Prediction (AV1/VP9)

Idea: Predict a block from its neighbors; code only the residual.
Adaptation: For each weight tile (e.g., 16×16), predict with row/col means, edge extrapolation, or a tiny learned linear predictor (? = a·left + b·top + c). Entropy-code only the residuals.
Why it helps: Strong local correlation in weight tensors ? very low-entropy residuals.

2) Transform Sets + RDOQ

Idea: Try multiple transforms (DCT, ADST, DST-VII), pick the one with best rate–distortion; then trellis/RDO quantization.
Adaptation: Per tile, test 4×4/8×8 DCT vs ADST; choose via RD cost J = D + ?R. Use a trellis to pick coefficient levels that minimize J.
Why it helps: Decorrelates structure; RDOQ avoids wasting bits on coefficients that don’t help accuracy.

3) Quadtree/BT Partitioning

Idea: Variable block sizes (64?32?16?8) chosen by RD.
Adaptation: Split weight matrices where variance is high; keep big blocks where it’s flat. Store a compact split tree per layer.
Why it helps: Spend bits where needed; cut header overhead with simple split codes.

4) Context-Adaptive Entropy Coding (ANS/CABAC-style)

Idea: Probability models conditioned on local context (neighbor significance, position, band).
Adaptation: Separate contexts for: (layer id, band (low/high freq), coefficient position class, neighbor-nonzero flags). Use rANS with ~32–64 contexts/layer.
Why it helps: 20–40% extra storage reduction over flat Huffman for the same quantizer.

5) Bitplane Coding with Significance Propagation (SPIHT/EZW-like)

Idea: Progressive bitplanes + trees that mark “insignificant” coeff groups.
Adaptation: After transform, encode MSB?LSB with a zerotree over sub-bands (or a simple parent?child map across downsampled frequency groups).
Why it helps: Very compact enhancement layers; can stop decoding at any plane for scalable precision.

6) Palette/Constant-Block Modes

Idea: For flat image areas, code a single palette index + residuals.
Adaptation: Detect near-constant or low-rank tiles; code (mean, tiny variance) only—optionally with rank-1 approximation.
Why it helps: Many tiles in deeper MLP layers are close to constant or rank-1 ? almost free to store.

7) KLT/Channel Transforms (Color-transform analogy)

Idea: Apply KLT/PCA to decorrelate channels before coding.
Adaptation: For attention projections, apply a small learned orthogonal transform across heads or across the output channel axis per tile; then quantize/encode.
Why it helps: Concentrates energy; fewer nonzeros after transform.

8) Importance-Guided Scalable Layers (Scalable Video Analogy)

Idea: Refinement layers only where they matter.
Adaptation: Use gradient/Fisher/Hessian scores per tile to decide how many bitplanes/residual layers to send. Embeddings/Q/K/V get more planes; mid-FFN tiles get fewer.
Why it helps: Same accuracy with fewer total bits than uniform 8-bit.

9) Inter “Temporal” Prediction (Across Checkpoints)

Idea: Video exploits frame-to-frame similarity; here exploit checkpoint-to-checkpoint similarity.
Adaptation: For LoRA/fine-tunes, code weights as base model + residual vs a public checkpoint; entropy-code the delta.
Why it helps: Residuals are tiny for many layers ? huge storage drop for variants.

10) Post-Dequant Reconstruction (In-loop Filter Analogy)

Idea: Deblocking/deringing filters improve decoded frames.
Adaptation: Tiny per-layer learned reconstructor (e.g., 1–2 linear layers) maps coarse decoded tiles ? better approximations; store a few shared params per layer.
Why it helps: Lets you quantize harder (fewer planes) for the same task accuracy.

A concrete progressive pipeline (fast + practical)

Tile & Predict: 16×16 tiles ? intra predict (row/col/linear).

Transform: Choose DCT/ADST per tile via a tiny RD probe.

Quantize: Trellis/RDOQ with per-band step sizes.

Progressive Code: Bitplanes with SPIHT-like significance maps.

Entropy Code: rANS with layer/band/neighbor contexts.

Scalable Allocation: Assign more planes to high-importance tiles (Fisher/grad); fewer elsewhere.

Decode/Run: On load, GPU parallel rANS ? inverse transform fused into GEMM prologue (adds/shifts). Optional tiny reconstructor.

Expected wins:

On-disk: 30–60% smaller than flat 8-bit quantization at equal effective precision (often better with inter-checkpoint residuals).

Runtime: Near-free if decode is per-layer on load and inverse transforms are fused into the GEMM prologue; inference cost within ~1–3%.

Flexibility: True progressive delivery and importance-aware final size for the same accuracy.

If you want, I can sketch pseudo-code for (a) RD tile selection, (b) SPIHT-style bitplane encoder for weight tiles, and (c) a CUTLASS-style GEMM prologue that performs inverse 8×8 integer DCT + dequant in shared memory.

You said:
which one of these techniques outlined has the most promise
ChatGPT said:

If the target is pushing LLM weight compression significantly beyond today’s quantization+Huffman baselines, the most promising candidates from that list are:

?? 1. Importance-guided scalable layers (video scalable coding analogy)

Why:

Most existing methods waste bits by treating all weights equally.

Sensitivity varies a lot: embeddings, Q/K/V projections, and logits are fragile; deep MLP blocks are very forgiving.

Allocating refinement layers only where Hessian/gradient sensitivity is high could cut bits 20–40% while holding accuracy constant.

Novelty: Hardly used in mainstream LLM toolchains yet.

Promise: Shrinks the final model size at equal performance, not just the stored model size.

Challenge: Needs a good, cheap proxy for sensitivity (e.g., Fisher diagonal, calibration gradients).

?? 2. Predictive + Transform coding of weight tiles (video intra prediction + DCT/ADST)

Why:

Weight tensors have strong local correlation (rows/cols are structured).

Intra prediction ? low-energy residuals.

DCT or ADST concentrates energy ? entropy coding is very efficient.

Novelty: Rare in LLM pipelines; explored only in a few NN compression papers.

Promise: Major savings on storage/transit; could combine with scalable coding.

Challenge: Must fuse inverse transform into GEMM kernels to avoid runtime overhead.

?? 3. Inter-checkpoint residual coding (video inter prediction analogy)

Why:

Many models are fine-tunes/LoRA adapters of a shared base.

Storing only residual weights vs. a public checkpoint slashes size.

Residuals are small and entropy-compress very well.

Novelty: Almost no standardization yet (except some LoRA delta checkpoints).

Promise: Enormous gains for ecosystems where many variants exist (HuggingFace, enterprise models).

Challenge: Requires agreement on a base checkpoint.

?? The Rest

Bitplane + entropy coding ? solid, but closer to a known baseline.

Quadtree partitioning ? nice, but secondary benefit compared to the three above.

Post-dequant reconstructor (in-loop filter) ? interesting, but adds runtime complexity.

? Most promising overall:

Importance-guided scalable layers.
It directly enables smaller models at the same performance, not just easier distribution. Combined with predictive+transform coding for storage, you’d have a true “AV1-style codec for weights.”

Do you want me to sketch what an importance-guided bit allocation algorithm would look like (like the RD-optimization loop in AV1, but with sensitivity instead of visual distortion)?

You said:
with these 3 options integrated, what would be the effect on run speed. Could things be decoded quickly or have operations done on the compressed form


ChatGPT said:
Thought for 12s

Short version: you can make all three play nicely without tanking throughput. If you design the pipeline so entropy/decode happens off the hot path and only cheap, fused steps run inside GEMM, the run-time hit is near-zero (often <1–3%), sometimes net-positive due to lower memory bandwidth.

Below is what to expect, option-by-option, and how to architect it so decoding is “free”.

Where decoding should live

Do on disk / load time (once per layer): entropy decode (rANS/Huffman), predictive residual reconstruction, inverse transforms, checkpoint deltas ? produce compute-friendly tiles (INT4/INT8 + per-tile scales/codebooks) in GPU global memory.

Do in the math kernel (per tile, per reuse): only very light steps that fuse into the GEMM prologue (bit unpack, multiply by scale/zero-point, optional tiny butterfly for an integer 8×8 transform). These are hidden under memory latency and tile reuse.

Avoid any heavy entropy decoding or branchy logic inside the inner loop.

1) Importance-guided scalable layers

What it changes: how many refinement planes/bit budget each layer/tile gets.

Runtime impact: None, if you finalize the chosen precision before serving. You simply end up with a mix of INT8/INT4 tiles (or some layers at higher precision). Tensor cores already love INT8/FP8; INT4 needs custom kernels but is standard now.

If you want on-the-fly refinement while serving: stream extra planes in the background, update tiles during idle periods or between batches. Still zero impact on the inner matmul.

Bottom line: This buys smaller models at the same accuracy with no speed penalty when applied offline.

2) Predictive + Transform coding of tiles (intra + DCT/ADST)

Storage/distribution: Big win (residuals compress great).

Runtime choices:

A) Decode once at load time (recommended):
Parallel rANS on GPU ? add back prediction ? inverse (I)DCT/ADST per tile ? quantize to INT8/INT4 layout. Cost is paid once per layer load; no per-token overhead.

B) Decode “just-in-time” per reuse (only if VRAM is tight):
Keep compressed tiles in global memory; upon loading into shared memory, run a tiny integer inverse transform (8×8 butterfly of adds/shifts) + dequant then feed tensor cores. Overhead per tile is a few dozen integer ops and is usually hidden by memory latency and the K-loop reuse. Expect ~0–3% slow-down if fused cleanly.

Operating on compressed form directly:

On the transform domain? Generally no—activations aren’t transformed, so you’d need transforms on activations too (which breaks the whole stack).

On codebooks/indices (vector-quantized weights)? Sometimes: you can read indices and expand via a small register-resident LUT per tile. This can be fast if memory access is coalesced, but random lookups can hurt. Good for load-time expansion; risky in the hot loop.

3) Inter-checkpoint residual coding (delta vs. base model)

Runtime impact: Zero. You reconstruct the target weights from the base + delta before serving and then quantize to the normal compute layout. Think of it as a better way to ship fine-tunes, not something that affects matmul.

Can we compute in the “compressed” domain?

Bit-packed INT4/INT2: Yes. Many kernels unpack bitplanes in shared memory/wrap dequant into the prologue, then use IMMA/DP4A. This is effectively “computing from compressed form,” and it’s fast.

True transform domain (DCT/ADST) multiply: Not practical for LLMs (mismatched domains).

Texture block compression (BCn/ASTC): You can store tiles in texture formats and let texture units decompress on fetch, but layouts/precision aren’t ideal for GEMM and you lose kernel fusion/contiguity. Great research toy, rarely a net win in practice.

Design patterns to keep decode “free”

All heavy decode at load time: rANS/Huffman, predictive add-back, inverse transform ? emit packed INT4/INT8 tiles + per-tile scales in a CUTLASS-friendly layout.

Fuse light steps into GEMM: bit unpack, scale/zero-point multiply, optional tiny integer inverse transform ? done in shared memory before MMA.

Exploit tile reuse: decode once per tile load, reuse across K iterations; the cost amortizes away.

GPU-native I/O compression: use GDeflate/DirectStorage or nvCOMP to move compressed checkpoints straight to VRAM; overlap with compute to hide I/O.

Expected speed impact (rule-of-thumb)
Technique	Where decode happens	Inference speed impact
Importance-guided scalable layers	Offline selection	0% (same as quantized runtime)
Predictive + transform coding (decode on load)	Layer load only	0% during inference
Predictive + transform coding (JIT per tile, fused)	GEMM prologue	~0–3%
Inter-checkpoint residual coding	Offline reconstruction	0%
Bit-packed INT4 with dequant in prologue	GEMM prologue	~0–2%, often bandwidth-limited speedup

(Assumes good kernels with shared-memory tiling and tensor-core MMA.)

Pitfalls to avoid

Entropy decode in the hot loop (don’t do this).

Uncoalesced LUT/codebook fetches (kills bandwidth).

Branchy per-coef logic inside kernels (wrecks warp efficiency).

Forgetting tile reuse (decode cost won’t amortize).

Bottom line

Yes, they can be decoded quickly—do heavy parts once (on load), keep only trivial, fused steps in the matmul path.

Operations “on compressed form” are practical for bit-packed low-bit weights (INT4/2) and codebook indices if expanded per tile; not for transform-domain weights.

With a sane layout, you’ll keep throughput within a couple percent of baseline quantized inference, while gaining sizable on-disk size reductions and deployment flexibility.

You said:
could any operations be sped up by doing the compressed form. For example in the case of base + residuals the base part of the calulation would only need to be done once so that could make the rest go faster.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 17s

Short answer: you don’t usually get a speedup just from “base + residual” unless you exploit structure in the residual or adapt the compute policy. But there are real wins if you design for them:

Where compressed-form helps throughput

Structured sparse residuals (e.g., N:M)

Bit-serial / bitplane early exit (adaptive precision)

If weights are stored in bitplanes, accumulate MSBs first to form a coarse

y.

Use a confidence/entropy criterion on logits or an error bound to decide whether to add more planes. Many tokens will not need LSB planes ? fewer MACs on average.

This is effectively “compute on compressed form” because you stop the multiply early.

Progressive upgrades of cached states (KV cache)

During generation, K/V for past tokens are cached. If you stream in enhancement layers later:

Update cached

If the residual is low-rank or sparse, this upgrade is much cheaper than recomputing

Wx for all cached tokens.

Net: progressive model “upgrades” don’t blow up runtime; they’re incremental.

Importance-guided mixed precision (less math where it doesn’t matter)

Allocate more bitplanes to sensitive tiles/layers (embeddings, Q/K/V, logits), fewer to forgiving MLP tiles.

At inference, many tiles run at lower precision (INT4 / fewer planes) ? less memory traffic and fewer effective operations, often bottleneck-dominated ? speedup.

Where it doesn’t help (so you don’t over-invest)

For a single token step with arbitrary

When enhancements arrive mid-run: incrementally update KV cache using residual only.

Expected effects on speed

Low-rank residuals: often neutral to faster vs. a single dense matmul (depends on rank).

Sparse residuals: faster if sparsity meets hardware’s structured patterns.

Bitplane early exit: average speedup on easy tokens/sequences; worst-case similar to baseline if all planes needed.

KV upgrade with residual only: big savings during progressive upgrade of a running model.

Bottom line

Yes—if you design the enhancement to be cheap to apply (low-rank/sparse) or allow adaptive early exit (bitplanes), you can make parts of inference faster than the dense baseline, not just smaller-on-disk. The wins come from structured residuals and adaptive compute, not from a naive “base+residual” split.

You said:
What do you think is the best we could hope for in terms of reduced memory usage while also increasing speed
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 7s

Here’s a realistic “ceiling” if you combine the best ideas we discussed and target modern NVIDIA hardware (Ada/Hopper) with tensor cores and 2:4 sparsity:

What’s achievable (order-of-magnitude)
Memory (VRAM / residency)

Weights

FP16 baseline ? INT8: ~2× smaller (baseline).

INT8 ? INT4 (packed) with per-tile scales: another ~2× ? ~4× smaller than FP16.

+ 2:4 structured sparsity (stored sparse): effective ~6–8× smaller than FP16 (depends on header/index overhead).

+ importance-guided mixed precision (some tiles stay INT8, many at INT4): often ~5–7× vs FP16 with minimal accuracy loss.

On-disk with progressive/entropy coding (bitplanes + rANS, intra-pred + DCT): 30–60% smaller than a flat INT4/INT8 checkpoint at the same effective precision (this helps download, not runtime VRAM).

KV cache / activations

KV to INT8: ~2×; KV to INT4: ~4×.

Paged KV + grouped/quantized attention: another practical reduction in peak residency/fragmentation.

Net: it’s common to cut end-to-end working set by ~3–5× vs an FP16 stack when you do weights + KV together.

Best we can hope for (robust, production-y):
5–7× VRAM reduction vs FP16 at near-parity quality (weights INT4/8 mix, 2:4 sparsity where it’s safe, KV at INT4/8).
Moonshot (with heavier sparsity/low-rank in tolerant blocks): ~8–10× vs FP16, but you’re now trading some accuracy on long tails unless you invest in QAT/finetune.

Speed (throughput / latency)

Transformer inference is often memory-bandwidth bound, so speedups come from:

fewer bytes moved (INT4/8 + KV quant),

tensor-core friendly math (IMMA/DP4A/FP8),

exploiting 2:4 sparsity,

and a bit of adaptive compute (bitplane early-exit, low-rank residuals).

Reasonable end-to-end expectations (per token, long-seq decode):

INT8 weights + INT8 KV + fused kernels: ~1.3–1.8× faster than FP16.

INT4 weights (packed) + INT8/INT4 KV: ~1.8–2.5× faster.

+ 2:4 sparsity on big GEMMs (safe layers only): ~2.2–3.0×.

+ adaptive compute (bitplane early-exit on easy tokens, low-rank residual paths): average extra 10–30% on top (workload-dependent).

Best we can hope for (without exotic custom silicon):
~2.5–3.5× throughput vs a solid FP16 baseline on Ada/Hopper, with the ~5–7× memory cut.
Absolute best-case (carefully chosen model/layers, lots of tolerant blocks, long sequences, strong engineering): ~4× is possible, but don’t count on it universally.

How to get there (stack recipe)

Offline (distribution)

Progressive checkpoint: intra-pred + 8×8 DCT ? bitplanes ? rANS.

Inter-checkpoint residuals for fine-tunes (delta vs a public base).

This shrinks downloads by 30–60% but doesn’t affect runtime.

Load-time (once per layer)

GPU-parallel entropy decode; reconstruct predicted/transform blocks.

Emit compute-ready tiles in INT4 (packed) or INT8 with per-tile scales, and mark 2:4 masks where validated.

Choose importance-guided precision: embeddings/QKV/logits at INT8, many MLP tiles at INT4, avoid sparsity where it hurts.

Runtime (per token)

Fused kernels: bit-unpack + dequant in the GEMM prologue; IMMA/DP4A for matmuls.

KV cache kept at INT4/8 with paged memory.

Optional adaptive early-exit on bitplanes (stop adding LSB planes when a confidence bound is met).

If using low-rank residuals for enhancements, the residual path is two thin GEMVs (cheap).

Where the risks are

Sparsity placement: apply 2:4 only to tolerant layers (many MLP blocks), not to embeddings/logits unless validated.

INT4 everywhere: tempting but risky; mix with INT8 where attention alignment is sensitive.

Kernel quality: the gains above assume good fused kernels (CUTLASS-class), coalesced memory, and tile reuse.

TL;DR

Memory: reliably 5–7× smaller than FP16 in VRAM (weights+KV), with 30–60% smaller files on disk from progressive entropy coding.

Speed: ~2.5–3.5× faster than FP16 in steady-state decode; ~4× is a stretch goal on friendly workloads.

The biggest wins come from INT4/8 + KV quant, 2:4 sparsity where safe, and importance-guided mixed precision—with progressive coding mainly boosting distribution rather than runtime.

You said:
How does this compare to current practices in use. are we doing anything novel here that would be meaningfully better than what is already done?

ChatGPT said:
Thought for 6s

Short answer: most production stacks already do INT8/INT4 quant, some KV-cache quant, and lots of kernel fusion—but they don’t do (a) importance-guided scalable coding, (b) predictive+transform (codec-style) weight coding, or (c) progressive/bitplane early-exit compute. Those three are novel enough to be meaningfully better—mainly for smaller models at equal accuracy and faster cold starts/streaming—if engineered well.

Here’s the comparison at a glance:

What’s common today (production)

Quantization: W8A8 / W4A16 (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant, TE-QDQ), FP8 on H100/B100.

KV cache: INT8 (increasingly INT4) + paged attention.

Speed tricks: FlashAttention-2/3, tensor-core IMMA/DP4A, fused QKV projections, speculative decoding.

Sparsity: Limited 2:4 use; often off because accuracy drops unless retrained.

Distribution: Ship flat checkpoints (fp16/int8). Occasional gzip/zstd; rarely true entropy models.

Adapters: LoRA/QLoRA for training; at inference weights are typically materialized dense.

What we’re proposing that’s new/different

Importance-guided scalable weights (rate–distortion bit allocation)

Novelty: Allocate more precision where it matters (embeddings/QK/logits) and stop refinement early in tolerant tiles/layers.

Why it beats today: Flat “all-INT8” spends bits everywhere; importance-guided can hit the same accuracy with fewer total bits (typ. 20–40% weight size drop beyond uniform INT8/INT4).

Risk: Needs a cheap, reliable sensitivity proxy (Fisher/grad cal), plus an automated allocation loop.

Predictive + transform coding (intra-prediction + DCT/ADST) with entropy coding

Novelty: Codec-style residualization + transform + rANS for checkpoint storage.

Why it beats today: Produces 30–60% smaller files than flat INT8/INT4 checkpoints at the same effective precision. Current stacks mostly don’t do this.

Runtime impact: None if decoded on load; tiny (<1–3%) if you fuse a small inverse transform into GEMM.

Progressive / bitplane models with early-exit compute

Novelty: Start with MSB planes; add LSB planes only if needed (confidence/entropy bound).

Why it beats today: Average-case compute and bandwidth drop on “easy” tokens; also enables fast start and background refinement. This is not in mainstream runtimes.

Risk: Needs robust stopping criteria and careful kernel design to avoid warp divergence.

Inter-checkpoint residual coding (delta vs base) standardized for deployment

Novelty: Store fine-tunes as compressed deltas with entropy coding (not just raw LoRA).

Why it beats today: Massively smaller ecosystems with many variants; zero runtime cost. Under-used beyond research repos.

Will this be meaningfully better?

Memory/size: Yes. With (1)+(2) you can realistically get 5–7× VRAM reduction vs fp16 (weights+KV), while your download size shrinks an extra 30–60% over flat int8/int4. That’s better than the typical W8A8+gzip baseline.

Speed: Also yes—mostly via bandwidth cuts and adaptive compute. Expect ~2.5–3.5× throughput vs fp16 on long-seq decode when combining INT4/8 + KV quant + selective 2:4 sparsity, with another 10–30% average from early-exit bitplanes on friendly workloads. That’s beyond what many “quant-only” stacks deliver.

Where this isn’t novel

Plain INT8/INT4 and simple Huffman/rANS on already-quantized tensors are known.

LoRA/low-rank is standard for training; using it as a structured residual for inference speedups is still niche but not unheard of.

Practical MVP to prove the value (no moonshots)

Importance scan & allocation: Run a calibration set to get per-tile sensitivity (Fisher/grad). Allocate INT8 for high-importance tiles, INT4 for the rest; validate accuracy.

Codec-style storage: Intra-predict + 8×8 DCT ? bitplane + rANS per tile; decode on GPU at load; emit CUTLASS-friendly INT4/INT8 tiles.

Early-exit prototype: Bit-packed INT4 weights with a two-stage accumulate (MSBs ? check bound ? add LSBs if needed) in one fused kernel; benchmark average tokens/sec vs fixed INT4.

If those three steps hit targets (?0.5 pp accuracy delta; ?25% smaller than uniform INT8 at equal accuracy; ?3% runtime overhead vs flat INT4/8—or a net speedup from early-exit), you’ve built something meaningfully better than current practice.

Let’s pin this down by comparing our proposed stack vs the current state of the art in practice (2025).

?? Baseline: Current Best Standard Practice

Weights: Importance-guided mix of INT8 (sensitive tiles) + INT4 (tolerant tiles), plus 2:4 structured sparsity where safe.

KV cache: INT4 by default (packed, with paged KV).

Checkpoint storage: Predictive + transform coding (intra-prediction + DCT) + bitplane + rANS, decoded on GPU at load.

Runtime: Bitplane-aware kernels with optional early-exit; low-rank/sparse residuals for enhancements.

?? Memory Footprint

Weights: ~5–7× smaller than FP16 in VRAM.

(vs ~2–3× today ? ~2–3× better than standard practice).

KV cache: ~4× smaller (INT4 vs FP16) ? ~2× smaller than current INT8.

Checkpoint file size: 30–60% smaller than today’s quantized checkpoints (due to entropy coding + transforms).

?? Overall memory reduction:

vs FP16: ~6–8× end-to-end.

vs today’s INT8 baseline: about 2–2.5× smaller in practice.

? Speed

INT8 baseline today: ~1.3–1.8× FP16.

INT4 + mixed precision + KV INT4 + 2:4 sparsity: ~2.5–3.5× FP16.

Bitplane early-exit (average case): +10–30% on top for easy tokens.

?? Overall throughput improvement:

vs FP16: ~2.5–3.5× faster (best case ~4× on long sequences with tolerant workloads).

vs today’s INT8 baseline: about 1.5–2× faster.

? Bottom Line

Memory: ~2–2.5× smaller than best practice today (total VRAM + disk).

Speed: ~1.5–2× faster than best practice today, with stable accuracy if sensitivity-guided precision is used.

New value: scalable precision (progressive loading, adaptive compute) and 30–60% smaller distribution sizes.

Would you like me to put this into a side-by-side table (baseline vs proposed) so you can see the reductions/speedups at a glance?

Think critically, what are pitfalls to the approach proposed and would it be practical for real world use
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 31s

Great question. Here’s the sober take—what can bite you, how likely, and how to make it practical.

Major pitfalls
Accuracy & robustness

Sensitivity misallocation: Importance scores (grad/Fisher) can be noisy and data-dependent. If your calibration set misses edge cases, you’ll under-allocate bits to fragile tiles (embeddings/QK/logits), causing rare but nasty failures.
Mitigate: overweight high-risk layers by policy (e.g., always INT8 for embeddings/QK/logits), use multiple calibration shards, add a small safety margin to bit budgets.

INT4 + 2:4 sparsity drift: INT4 everywhere or aggressive structured sparsity can degrade long-sequence stability and rare tasks without QAT/finetune.
Mitigate: keep attention and output heads denser (INT8, no 2:4), apply sparsity mainly to MLPs, and validate on long-context and safety evals.

Early-exit bias: Bitplane early-exit needs a reliable stopping criterion. Too eager ? silent quality loss; too conservative ? no speedup.
Mitigate: bound error via per-tile residual norms; gate on downstream confidence (logit margin/entropy) with a small guard band.

Systems & performance

Kernel complexity & divergence: Fancy per-tile modes (different precisions/planes) can fragment kernels and hurt occupancy/coalescing.
Mitigate: bucket tiles into a handful of modes (e.g., {INT8, INT4-MSB-only, INT4-full}) and launch one kernel per bucket; avoid branchy inner loops.

Decode on the hot path: Entropy decoding or transform inversion inside GEMM will tank throughput.
Mitigate: do heavy decode at load time to emit compute-ready packed INT4/INT8 tiles; only allow light bit-unpack/dequant in the GEMM prologue.

Startup latency: GPU decode + reconstruction adds seconds on multi-GB checkpoints.
Mitigate: overlap with model warm-up, persist decoded tiles to a cache on local NVMe (checksum-gated), or pre-bake for production images.

Memory fragmentation: Many small metadata blocks (scales, codebooks, masks) can increase allocator churn.
Mitigate: use SoA layouts and per-layer contiguous blobs; align to 128B/256B; pre-allocate arenas.

Tooling & portability

Hardware dependence: 2:4 sparsity acceleration is NVIDIA-specific; INT4 maturity differs across vendors; some backends (TPU, ROCm) may lack equivalent fast paths.
Mitigate: maintain a portability matrix; fall back to mixed INT8/FP8 on platforms without INT4/2:4; keep a “plain quantized” build.

Framework friction: Triton/XLA/ONNX runtimes aren’t built for progressive precision knobs.
Mitigate: wrap custom CUDA/CUTLASS ops behind stable PyTorch/TensorRT plugins; keep graph shapes static; gate progressive features with env flags.

Operational complexity: More modes = bigger test matrix (models × precisions × seq lengths × devices).
Mitigate: tiered profiles (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive), CI with smoke + weekly deep evals, automatic rollback to the conservative profile.

Distribution & legalities

Delta-vs-base coupling: Inter-checkpoint residuals require pinning an exact base version; drift breaks decoding.
Mitigate: include base hash, enforce resolver, host mirrored bases; check license compatibility.

Is it practical?

Yes—for server inference where you control the runtime (C++/CUDA, TensorRT/Triton) and can afford an integration cycle. It’s realistic to ship:

Codec-style storage (predict+transform+ANS) decoded on GPU at load ? 30–60% smaller downloads, no runtime cost.

Importance-guided mixed precision (INT8 for sensitive tiles, INT4 for MLP tiles) ? real VRAM cuts and speedups with parity accuracy.

Selective 2:4 sparsity in tolerant MLP layers only ? additional wins with minimal quality impact.

(Optional) Early-exit bitplanes behind a feature flag for workloads that benefit (deterministic batch decode, lower risk).

Less practical on:

Mobile/edge (no custom kernels or 2:4 acceleration; memory tight but toolchain inflexible).

Strictly managed clouds/TPUs where you can’t deploy custom ops.

Recommended rollout (low-risk path)

Phase 1—Safe wins (4–6 weeks):

Quantization policy: INT8 for embeddings/QK/V/out, INT4 for most MLP tiles.

No sparsity yet. No early-exit.

Add codec-style checkpoint compression (GPU decode on load).

Target: ?0.5 pp accuracy delta; 1.6–2.2× speed vs FP16; ~2× VRAM cut vs INT8-only.

Phase 2—Sparsity where safe (4–8 weeks):

Apply 2:4 to selected MLP matmuls, validate long-context + safety sets.

Target: +10–25% throughput, small extra VRAM savings.

Phase 3—Adaptive compute (R&D):

Bitplane early-exit and/or low-rank residual enhancements with KV-cache upgrade path.

Roll out behind a traffic-gated flag; monitor tail-latency and drift.

Guardrails & observability

Live canaries comparing logits/KL vs a reference INT8 model.

Per-layer “budget leaks” (tiles promoted from INT4?INT8 at runtime if error bound exceeded).

Fail-safe to revert to conservative profile automatically on anomaly.

Bottom line: The approach is practical for real-world server inference and meaningfully better than today’s “quantize-and-ship” standard—if you keep decode off the hot path, limit mode explosion, and apply conservative policies to sensitive layers. The main risks are engineering complexity and robustness under distribution shift; both are manageable with staged rollout, safeguards, and strong eval coverage.

You said:
are their any other ideas or concepts proposed recently for llm compression/speedup trying to achieve similar improvements we are

ChatGPT said:

Yes — there’s a lot of activity in this space. Many groups are trying to push beyond “just INT8 quantization” with approaches that, like ours, aim for smaller + faster + robust. Here’s a structured rundown of what’s been proposed recently (2023–2025), and how it compares to what we’ve been discussing.

?? Emerging Concepts in LLM Compression / Speedup
1. Mixed-Precision Quantization (importance-guided)

What it is: Assign different precisions to layers/tiles based on sensitivity (some INT8, many INT4, sometimes INT2).

Recent work:

QMoE (2024): used mixed INT2/INT4/INT8 in MoEs, guided by per-expert sensitivity.

ZeroQuant-V2 (MSR, 2023–2024): automatic bit allocation with Hessian-based sensitivity analysis.

Relation to us: We’re in the same spirit — but we added a codec-style progressive coding layer for distribution + optional compute savings (bitplane early-exit).

2. Ultra-low-bit quantization (INT2 / Binary)

What it is: Push weights/activations to 2 bits or even 1 bit.

Recent work:

BiLLM (2024): binary-weight LLMs with retraining, modest accuracy drops.

FP2/INT2 LLMs (2024): prototypes show 8–10× smaller models, but often fragile.

Relation to us: These aim for extreme compression, but require QAT or special training. Our approach tries to keep parity without retraining.

3. Structured Sparsity

What it is: Enforce patterns (2:4, 4:8) that map to hardware accelerators.

Recent work:

NVIDIA’s Ampere/Hopper 2:4 kernels actively supported.

Research on dynamic sparsity (prune different weights per input).

Relation to us: We adopt safe 2:4 sparsity in tolerant blocks — more conservative than dynamic sparsity proposals.

4. Low-Rank + Residual Decomposition (LoRA-inspired for inference)

What it is: Store a dense base model + low-rank residuals instead of full weights.

Recent work:

QLoRA (2023): train adapters in 4-bit.

Delta Decomposition (2024): compress inference weights into base + structured residual.

Relation to us: We fold this into our “base + residual” + bitplane model, with the twist that residuals could be low-rank and act as enhancement layers.

5. KV Cache Compression

What it is: Quantize or compress the autoregressive cache.

Recent work:

KVQuant (2024): stable INT4/INT8 KV caches.

MiKV (2024): adaptive precision for KV depending on attention importance.

PagedAttention / vLLM (2023–2025): reduce memory fragmentation, page KV to disk.

Relation to us: We already assumed INT4 KV + paging. The new twist is adaptive precision KV (per-head or per-layer).

6. Speculative Decoding + Draft Models

What it is: Use a small draft model to propose tokens, then verify with the big model.

Recent work:

Medusa, SpecInfer (2023–2024).

Relation to us: Different axis — reduces FLOPs/token, not memory. But can stack with our approach for bigger net wins.

7. Activation/Gradient Pruning (for training + inference)

What it is: Skip compute for activations with low contribution.

Recent work:

ACT-Prune (2024): dynamic neuron skipping at inference.

Relation to us: Similar in spirit to our early-exit bitplanes — adaptive compute.

8. Model Merging / Checkpoint Deltas

What it is: Store/ship only differences between models (inter-checkpoint deltas).

Recent work:

DiffPruning (ICLR 2023): fine-tunes as sparse deltas.

AdapterSoup (2024): merge small adapters to recreate a large model.

Relation to us: We suggested standardizing inter-checkpoint residuals with entropy coding — similar direction, but less explored for inference.

9. Novel Hardware-Aware Formats

What it is: Design storage/compute formats tailored for tensor cores.

Recent work:

FP8 (Hopper, B100) now common.

MXFP (2024): mixed mantissa/exponent FP for LLMs.

Relation to us: We’re proposing codec-style formats (bitplanes + transforms) that aren’t hardware-native yet — but could become one if adopted.

? Where we are clearly novel

Codec-inspired transforms & predictive coding for checkpoint storage (borrowing from AV1/VP9).

Progressive/scalable weights with early-exit compute, i.e. not just storage but adaptive inference cost.

Importance-guided bit allocation + progressive refinement ? smaller models at equal accuracy rather than just different fixed quantized versions.

Most current work stops at “quantize to INT4/INT8 + entropy code” or “speculative decoding”; very few are blending scalable coding concepts from video into LLM weights. That’s where our approach stands out.

?? Critical practicality check:

Distribution/storage: Our codec-style compression is low-risk and directly deployable.

Memory/runtime: Importance-guided mixed precision is practical (similar to ZeroQuant-V2), but early-exit compute is still researchy.

Net novelty: If we prove progressive + adaptive bit allocation works robustly, it would be meaningfully better than the current “flat INT4 + gzip” standard.

Would you like me to build a side-by-side landscape table (Our approach vs. Current baselines vs. Emerging research), so you can quickly see where the gaps and opportunities are?

You said:
i heard there is now an fp 8 and fp4 supported on recent nvidia cards, could we incorporate this, what would be the advantages, disadvantages and is it a good idea
ChatGPT said:

Yes — NVIDIA has added FP8 (H100, B100) and now experimental FP4 support in Hopper/B100 and Blackwell-class GPUs. These are hardware-native formats, which makes them very interesting for your compression/speedup goals. Let’s break it down.

?? FP8
What it is

Two variants: E4M3 (4 exponent, 3 mantissa bits) and E5M2.

~8× smaller than FP64, ~2× smaller than FP16.

Hopper tensor cores can run FP8 GEMMs at ~2× throughput of FP16.

Advantages

Hardware-native: No need to unpack/bitplane decode — it runs directly on tensor cores.

Good dynamic range (better than INT8 for some cases, especially activations).

Training + inference: Can be used for both; NVIDIA has stable scaling rules.

Software support: PyTorch AMP for FP8 exists, plus TensorRT kernels.

Disadvantages

Less compression than INT4/INT2: Only 2× smaller than FP16; INT4 gets you 4×.

Accuracy-sensitive: Some layers (softmax, layernorm, embeddings) still need FP16 or mixed precision.

Vendor lock-in: Mainly NVIDIA; AMD/Intel don’t expose FP8 yet.

Good idea?

? For datacenter inference/training: yes, FP8 is very practical and already widely adopted.
? For maximal compression (e.g., trying to hit 5–7× VRAM cuts), FP8 alone won’t get you there — it’s a moderate step.

?? FP4
What it is

New on Blackwell (B100, 2025).

4-bit floating point format (probably variants like E2M1).

Intended for ultra-low-precision GEMMs with hardware acceleration.

Advantages

Native hardware support: If tensor cores accept FP4, it’s much easier than building custom INT4 kernels.

Potential sweet spot: Combines dynamic range of FP with INT4-like compression (4× smaller than FP16).

Could outperform INT4: Less need for per-tile scales/zero-points, so lower metadata overhead.

Disadvantages

Brand new: Toolchain immaturity (limited PyTorch/TensorRT support initially).

Accuracy risk: FP4 is extremely coarse; may require fine-tuning or importance-guided allocation to avoid collapse.

Unknown sparsity interactions: Might not play nicely with 2:4 structured sparsity yet.

Likely inference-only: Unlikely to be stable for training.

Good idea?

? Worth exploring for weights in tolerant layers (MLPs).
?? Risky for embeddings/QK/softmax outputs — those are usually precision-critical.
? Not portable: Only NVIDIA Blackwell+ will have support.

?? How we could incorporate FP8 / FP4 into our codec-inspired stack

Base precision:

Use FP8 for most weights/activations.

Reserve FP16/INT8 for fragile layers.

Already gives ~2× VRAM reduction, ~2× faster matmuls.

Aggressive refinement with FP4:

Store MLP blocks in FP4 (4× smaller than FP16).

Keep embeddings, attention projections in FP8/INT8.

Mix with progressive enhancement layers for recovery (bitplane-coded residuals).

Progressive layering:

Base = FP4 (coarse, small).

Enhancement = FP8 or INT8 refinement for critical tiles.

This blends hardware-native precision with codec-style scalable coding.

?? Bottom line

FP8: Already a good, stable idea for both training and inference. You get ~2× speed & ~2× memory reduction, with relatively low engineering overhead.

FP4: Very promising for next-gen NVIDIA inference, but bleeding-edge. Likely needs selective deployment (MLPs only, with refinements).

Novelty vs current practice: Current “best practice” is INT8/INT4 quant + FP16 fallback. If you fold in FP8/FP4 hardware-native math + codec-style progressive refinements, you can combine the robustness of FP with the compression of INT. That could be meaningfully better than today’s baselines, but only on the newest GPUs.

?? Would you like me to put together a comparison table (INT8 vs INT4 vs FP8 vs FP4 vs our codec-style approach) showing tradeoffs in memory, speed, accuracy risk, and deployment maturity? That way you can see where each method shines.

You said:
bascially i want to know if i should incorporate fp8 and or fp4 into our codec style approach or leave it for a future iteration
ChatGPT said:

Got it — you want a decision framework, not just specs. Let’s look at this critically in the context of your codec-style progressive approach.

? Where FP8/FP4 fit
FP8

Pros: Mature on H100/B100, supported in PyTorch AMP and TensorRT; delivers ~2× smaller and ~2× faster matmuls than FP16; robust enough for training & inference.

Cons: Only 2× smaller than FP16 ? weaker compression than INT4. Needs mixed precision fallback for fragile layers.

Fit with codec approach:

FP8 can be your “safe base layer” for critical weights (embeddings, Q/K/V, logits).

Enhancements (bitplanes, residuals) can be layered on top of FP8 without breaking the design.

Minimal engineering risk: it’s a drop-in for existing GEMMs.

Verdict: Incorporate FP8 now. It’s stable, hardware-native, and pairs nicely with importance-guided bit allocation (FP8 for fragile tiles, INT4/bitplane for tolerant ones).

FP4

Pros: 4× smaller than FP16; could give INT4-like compression but with FP dynamic range; native tensor core support coming on Blackwell.

Cons: Brand new, toolchains immature; accuracy risks (fragile layers likely can’t survive in FP4); limited to NVIDIA Blackwell+ hardware ? not portable.

Fit with codec approach:

FP4 would naturally be the lowest-precision base layer in a progressive scheme (FP4 base + FP8/INT8 residuals).

Could simplify metadata (fewer per-tile scales than INT4).

But fragile to accuracy drift ? would need careful evaluation and probably QAT.

Verdict: Treat FP4 as future iteration. Wait for toolchains and community benchmarks. Prototype it in tolerant MLP layers only, but don’t bet your design on it yet.

?? Recommendation

Use FP8 now in your codec-style system for the “precision floor” of critical layers. It integrates smoothly, is production-ready, and gives you robustness.

Stick with INT4 (packed, codec-enhanced) + sparsity for aggressive compression in tolerant layers — this is where you’ll hit your 5–7× VRAM cuts.

Keep FP4 in the roadmap for when Blackwell support matures; at that point you can revisit a FP4 base + FP8 enhancement scheme for progressive refinement.

?? So in practice:

Now: FP8 + INT4/INT8 + codec-style scalable layers.

Later: FP4 base layers when stable, with progressive refinement as “bitplane/enhancement.”

Would you like me to sketch a layer-by-layer allocation policy (e.g., embeddings = FP8, attention = FP8/INT8, MLP = INT4, etc.) showing how FP8 could be folded into your codec pipeline right now?

You said:
im running an RTX 5090, this should be compatible correct?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 45s

Short answer: yes—your RTX 5090 (Blackwell) has hardware for FP8 and FP4. FP8 is mature-ish; FP4 is brand-new and still rolling into toolchains.

Why I’m confident

NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 5090 product page and Blackwell literature highlight 5th-gen Tensor Cores with FP4 support; Blackwell also carries forward the FP8 Transformer Engine (2nd gen on RTX Blackwell).

NVIDIA

NVIDIA’s developer posts confirm FP8 on Hopper/Blackwell and introduce TensorRT FP4 paths (initially showcased for image gen, but it’s the same HW datapath). 
NVIDIA Developer

What that means for your codec-style plan

FP8: Safe to incorporate now on 5090 for precision-sensitive layers (embeddings, Q/K/V, logits). You’ll get ~2× mem/throughput vs FP16 with good stability, and it plugs cleanly into your importance-guided scheme. (Tooling: current CUDA/TensorRT stacks already expose FP8.) 
NVIDIA

FP4: Supported in hardware on 5090, but software support for LLMs is still catching up (TensorRT 10.8 showcases FP4, early focus was image generation). Plan to pilot FP4 on tolerant MLP blocks only, keep critical paths FP8/INT8, and gate it behind a flag until TensorRT-LLM / PyTorch backends finalize kernels. 
NVIDIA Developer
+1

Practical checklist

Use latest CUDA + TensorRT and (when available) TensorRT-LLM builds that expose FP8/FP4 on Blackwell. (GeForce page: “Max AI performance with FP4.”) 
NVIDIA

Start with: FP8 for fragile layers, INT4 (packed) or FP4 trials for MLP tiles, + your progressive/entropy codec for storage. Roll FP4 wider only after accuracy burn-in.

If you want, I can sketch an allocation policy for 5090 specifically (which layers to put in FP8 vs FP4/INT4, and where to keep sparsity off) and map it to TensorRT config knobs.

You said:
Ok we've had a long conversation so far, lets take a step back and analyze everything mentioned so far. Our goal is a research plan to explore and develop techniques that are novel and would be of the most value. Earlier in the converstation we mentioned these :                                                            ? Most promising, under-exploited directions:

Predictive coding of weight blocks (neighbor prediction ? small residuals).

Transform coding (DCT/learned transforms ? compressible coefficients).

Rate–distortion optimization using accuracy sensitivity (smart bit allocation).

Progressive/scalable weight coding (streaming / adaptive deployment).

Context-adaptive entropy coding (ANS with local statistics).                                                                       If I had to bet: (1) predictive coding + (3) accuracy-aware rate-distortion are the low-hanging fruit that could give real storage wins with minimal accuracy loss. (4) progressive coding is the most disruptive — it could change how models are delivered (like scalable video).                                                         From how our conversation progressed is this still the case? Outline which techniques would be best to explore. 
ChatGPT said:

Love the reset. Yes—the earlier take still holds after everything we discussed. Here’s a crisp, prioritized research plan that targets novelty + real-world value on your RTX 5090 stack.

Goals (what “success” means)

Equal accuracy, smaller + faster. Hit ?0.5 pp accuracy delta vs strong INT8 baselines while:

Storage: ?30–60% smaller checkpoints than flat INT8/INT4.

VRAM: ?2× reduction vs today’s INT8-only stacks (end-to-end, incl. KV).

Speed: ?1.5–2× faster than today’s INT8 baselines on long-seq decode.

Priority Order (most value ? least engineering risk)
P1. Predictive coding of weight blocks + Transform coding (DCT/ADST) + Context-adaptive entropy (ANS)

Why now: Biggest storage win with minimal runtime risk (decode at load). Under-exploited, codec DNA.
What to build:

Tile weights (e.g., 16×16). Intra-predict (left/top/linear). Code residuals.

Try 8×8 DCT vs ADST, pick by tiny RD probe; quantize coefficients.

Bitplane the coeffs; entropy code per context (layer, band, position, neighbor-nonzero) with rANS.
Expected: 30–60% smaller files than flat INT8/INT4 checkpoints at same effective precision; 0% runtime hit if decoded on load; ?3% if you fuse a tiny integer inverse transform in GEMM prologue.
Novelty: Higher than current practice; immediate value for distribution & cold start.

P2. Rate–distortion (accuracy-aware) bit allocation

Why now: Converts storage wins into final model size wins at equal accuracy.
What to build:

Compute per-tile sensitivity (Fisher/grad) on a small calibration set.

Allocate precision per tile: keep fragile tiles FP8/INT8; push tolerant tiles to INT4 (or FP4 trials).

Optimize a simple RD objective: J = ?Loss_est + ?·(bits), solved greedily per layer.
Expected: 20–40% fewer bits than uniform INT8/INT4 at parity accuracy.
Novelty: Rarely used in LLM toolchains; high practical impact.

P3. Progressive / scalable weight coding (base + enhancement layers)

Why now (disruptive): One artifact serves phones ? servers; enables fast start + background refinement and adaptive compute (optional).
What to build:

Store MSB planes as base, LSB planes/residuals as enhancements.

Let runtime stop at base for tolerant tiles/layers; stream more planes as needed.

Keep heavy entropy decode off the hot path; optionally fuse bitplane early-exit inside GEMM for average-case speedups.
Expected: Same accuracy with smaller effective models (since many tiles stop early), faster cold starts; +10–30% average speedup from early-exit on easy tokens.
Novelty: Largely unexplored for LLMs; strategically important.

Secondary (valuable, but after P1–P3)
S1. Inter-checkpoint residual coding (delta vs base)

What: Ship fine-tunes as ANS-compressed deltas vs a public base; reconstruct on load.
Why: Massive ecosystem storage savings; zero runtime cost.
When: In parallel with P1 (same codec infra).

S2. Structured residuals for compute (low-rank / 2:4 sparse)

What: Keep base dense INT8/FP8; make residual low-rank or 2:4 sparse to apply cheaply.
Why: Turns “enhancement” into faster math; incremental speedups beyond bandwidth wins.
When: After P2; needs careful accuracy checks.

Hardware-aware choices (RTX 5090, Blackwell)

Use FP8 now for precision-critical tiles (embeddings, Q/K/V, logits) ? robust & fast.

Use INT4 (packed) for tolerant MLP tiles for VRAM cuts and speed; keep per-tile scales.

Pilot FP4 only as an R&D toggle in MLPs once TensorRT-LLM exposes stable kernels; keep FP8/INT8 fallback.

KV cache at INT4/INT8 with paged attention.

Experiments & Milestones
M0 — Baselines

Models: Llama-3/3.1 8B & 13B.

Tasks: MMLU, GSM8K, HellaSwag, long-context eval; your internal evals.

Runtimes: FP16, INT8 (best existing), INT4 (AWQ/GPTQ). Capture quality, VRAM, tokens/s.

M1 — Codec storage (P1)

Implement tiles ? intra-pred ? {DCT, ADST} ? bitplanes ? rANS.

KPIs: file size ? ?30%, decode latency ? model warm-up, ?acc ?0.1 pp vs same quant.

M2 — RD bit allocation (P2)

Sensitivity scan (Fisher/grad) on 5–10k tokens.

Allocate INT8/INT4 per tile; freeze; re-eval.

KPIs: model VRAM ? ?20% vs uniform INT8/INT4 at ?0.5 pp ?acc.

M3 — Progressive delivery (P3)

Produce base+enhancement artifact; boot on base; refine in background.

Optional bitplane early-exit kernel with a simple logit-margin bound.

KPIs: cold-start time ? ?30%; avg tokens/s +10–30% on easy workloads; no QoR drift.

M4 — Inter-delta & structured residuals (S1, S2)

Ship a fine-tune as ANS-delta vs base; reconstruct on load.

Try low-rank residuals for hot MLPs; measure FLOP savings vs dense.

KPIs: delta size ? full checkpoint; residual path non-regressing latency.

Risks & Mitigations

Sensitivity misallocation ? accuracy blips: keep hard rules (FP8 for embeddings/Q/K/V/logits), add safety margin in RD.

Kernel complexity / divergence: bucket tiles into a few modes (e.g., FP8, INT8, INT4-full, INT4-MSB-only).

Startup latency from decode: do GPU decode once; cache reconstructed tiles on NVMe; multithread layer loads.

Portability: keep a “no-codec, pure INT8” fallback build.

Measurement rubric (decide go/no-go)

Parity target: ?0.5 pp avg loss to INT8 strong baseline across your evals.

Storage: ?30% smaller than flat INT8; stretch 50–60%.

VRAM (weights+KV): ?2× smaller than INT8-only stack (end-to-end).

Speed: ?1.5× vs INT8 baseline; stretch 2×+.

Operational: decode-time overhead fits within warm-up; no significant tail-latency regressions.

TL;DR recommendation

Yes, still the case:

(P1) Predictive + transforms + ANS (storage wins, low risk).

(P2) Accuracy-aware RD allocation (turns storage into true size/VRAM wins).

(P3) Progressive/scalable coding (most disruptive; streaming + adaptive compute).

Add inter-delta (S1) for ecosystems with many fine-tunes, and structured residuals (S2) for extra compute wins.
