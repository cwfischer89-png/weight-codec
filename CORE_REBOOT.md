# Core Codec - Fresh Start

## Why the Reboot?

After 6 weeks of implementation, we had:
- ✅ 12,000+ lines of code
- ✅ Many features (transforms, bitplanes, containers)
- ❌ No working end-to-end pipeline
- ❌ Untested integration
- ❌ Multiple competing formats

**Problem:** Built horizontally (many features) instead of vertically (one working system).

## The Core Reboot

Started fresh with **minimal, essential features**:

### What We Kept
- ✅ Predictive coding (LEFT/TOP/AVG/PLANAR)
- ✅ rANS entropy coding
- ✅ GPU decode with CUDA
- ✅ Python bindings

### What We Removed
- ❌ Transform coding (DCT/ADST) - 600 lines
- ❌ Bitplane coding - 400 lines
- ❌ CPU decoder - 400 lines
- ❌ Multiple container formats - 1000+ lines
- ❌ Complex metadata/versioning - 500 lines

### Result
- **Old:** 12,000 lines, doesn't work
- **New:** 1,200 lines, should work immediately

```

**Strategy:** Keep old code for reference, but focus all testing on `core/`.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Navigate to core
cd core

# Build
./build.sh

# Test
python3 test_core.py
```

## Expected Output

```
=== Test 1: Small Data (64x64) ===
Original: (64, 64), 4096 bytes
Compressed: 2048 bytes (2.00x)
Decode time: 0.123 ms
Bit-exact: True
✓ Test 1 PASSED

=== Test 2: Medium Data (256x256) ===
Original: (256, 256), 64.0 KB
Compressed: 32.0 KB (2.00x)
Decode time: 0.5 ms
Speedup: 100x faster
Bit-exact: True
✓ Test 2 PASSED

```

## What This Achieves

### Immediate
1. **Working pipeline** - Encode, compress, decode, verify
2. **GPU acceleration** - CUDA kernels actually used
3. **Testable** - Can validate correctness immediately

### Research Goals
1. **Measure compression ratio** on real LLM weights
2. **Measure decode speed** on RTX 5090
3. **Prove concept** works before adding complexity

### Next Steps
1. Get this working on RunPod
2. Test on real LLM checkpoint
3. Optimize for throughput
4. Add features as needed

## Why This Will Work

### Previous Approach
```
Week 1: Encoder ❌ (not tested)
Week 2: Decoder ❌ (not tested)
Week 3: Transforms ❌ (not tested)
Week 4: GPU ❌ (not tested)
Week 5: Container ❌ (not tested)
Week 6: More features ❌ (still not tested)
```

### Current Approach
```
Day 1: Core implementation ✓ (test immediately)
Day 2: Fix bugs, optimize
Day 3: Add features (if needed)
```

## Technical Differences

### Format
**Old:** Complex container with layers, metadata, checksums
```
[GlobalHeader][LayerIndex][Metadata×N][CRC][Data]
```

**New:** Simple GPU-friendly format
```
[Header][TileMetadata×N][Data]
```

### Decoder
**Old:** Multiple decoders with fallback
- `Decoder` (CPU)
- `GPUDecoder` (wrapper)
- `GPUDecoderFull` (actual)

**New:** One GPU decoder
- `GPUDecoder` - that's it

### Testing
**Old:** Test at the end (never got there)

**New:** Test immediately
- `test_core.py` runs full pipeline
- 4 test cases (small, medium, large, patterns)
- Clear pass/fail

## Migration Path

Once `core/` is working:

1. **Keep core as reference implementation**
   - Simple, tested, working
   - Use for validation

2. **Add features incrementally**
   - Transform coding (if compression needs improvement)
   - Bitplane coding (if progressive decode needed)
   - Multi-layer containers (if needed)

3. **Optimize**
   - Profile GPU kernels
   - Tune for 5090 architecture
   - Optimize memory transfers

## Philosophy

> "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" - Kent Beck

We skipped "make it work" and went straight to "make it feature-complete".

Now: **Make it work first.**

## Status

- [x] Core implementation written
- [ ] Build on RunPod
- [ ] Pass bit-exact tests
- [ ] Test on LLM checkpoint
- [ ] Measure performance
- [ ] Optimize

**Current task:** Build and test on RunPod with RTX 5090.
